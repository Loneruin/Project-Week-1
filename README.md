# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL

My goal for the project:

1. Practice create new database, table and import csv file to Pgadmin4

2. Learn how to investigate the data and cleaning data before analyzing

3. Analyzing data, take a look at the pattern from the provided data and find the connection

4. Provide the the results and solutions if possible after analyzing data

## Process
Step 1: Create ecommerce database
Step 2: Create table base on the csv file
Step 3: Cleaning data
Step 4: Analyzing data
Step 5: Data quality assurance
## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
This is the first time I'm analyzing data by myself so there are quite a lot of challenges:

1. I need to look for the meaning of some header because it doesn't have any explaination file
2. The data is quite disorganzie and is required to clean a lot
3. Because of lacking experiences, it is difficult for me to give any results after analyzing data

## Future Goals
If I have more time, I will try my best to clean the data more thoroughly and have a better analysis when gaining more experience and more understanding of the expectation of the analysis
